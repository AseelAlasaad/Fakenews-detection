# Fakenews-detection

The project aims to develop a machine-learning model capable of identifying and classifying any news article as fake or not.

This project involves building and training a model to classify news as fake news or not using a diverse dataset of news articles. I have used different machine learning models to determine the results of the model.

# Dataset 

I have used a labelled dataset containing news articles from kaggle .  The dataset is divided into two classes:
1. True
2. Fake

# Software
 Anaconda
 Spyder

# Dependencies
following libraries and packages used:
1. Scikit-learn
2. Pandas
3. Numpy
4. Seaborn
5. Matplotlib
6. nltk
